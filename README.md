# teacher-app
Private teacher finder application for iOS and Android using Unity. As a backend I used Firebase with custom functions (thumbnail generation, fcm notifications)  
My own code (not plugins) is inside Assets/App codes  
Need Unity (2017.x) to compile the code  

This project was mainly a research whether Unity is a proper tool to build non-game mobile applications (it is not)
